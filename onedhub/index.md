# What is OnEdHub?

From the outset, we have adhered to both national and international standards for data sharing, deliberately selecting
formats that we consider the most forward-looking. Vigilo uses APIs for all data exchanges and was, for example, among
the first in Europe to be certified according to the IMS OneRoster standard, which is aimed at data sharing in the
education sector. We believe this is essential for an administrative system in the education sector, given the type of
information that the solution contains and exchanges with other systems.

Through Onedhub, we aim to refine data-sharing functionality by offering an integration platform that provides core
functionality for managing kindergartens and schools. This core functionality includes managing personal data in
compliance with GDPR, enrollment/admission, class/group organization, and invoicing/parent payments. Through the
integration platform, itâ€™s possible to connect this functionality to other Vigilo modules or compatible third-party
services. Data is exchanged through standardized APIs and the IMS OneRoster format, allowing the widest range of
third-party services access to the platform. This approach allows customers to assemble a comprehensive system tailored
to their specific needs. Through Onedhub, we aim to make it easier, faster, and more affordable to integrate new
services with the customer's other solutions. Vigilo will certify third-party providers to ensure that all data
transfers are seamless, secure, and accurate. These services will then be presented in the Marketplace alongside
Vigilo's own products. The combination of an open and scalable integration platform with Vigilo's Marketplace will give
customers far more flexibility than today. Rather than being tied to long contracts and costly implementation projects,
customers will be able to add and replace modules easily, ensuring that they always have the most up-to-date and
best-suited system for their needs.
